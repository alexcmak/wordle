# wordle

This is a simple implementation of the Wordle game from New York Times.
You have 6 chances to guess a 5 letter word.
Each guess must be a real English word. I have a list of 5 letter words in a separate file and a database.

If you guess exactly correct letter and correct position you get a green color.
If you guess right letter but wrong position you get a orange color.
If you guess a totally not appear letter you get a grey color.

I've done both java version and python version
